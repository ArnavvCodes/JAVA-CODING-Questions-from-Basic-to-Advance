PROBLEM:
Create a menu-driven program where the user can enter 1 or 0.

If the user enters 1, the program repeatedly takes input for a student’s marks (out of 100) and prints a message based on the score:

Marks ≥ 90 → "This is Good"

60 ≤ Marks ≤ 89 → "This is also Good"

0 ≤ Marks ≤ 59 → "This is Good as well" (because marks don’t matter, effort does)

If the user enters 0, the program stops.

Any other input is treated as invalid.

CODE:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class grading {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        for ( ; ; )
        {
            int c = sc.nextInt();
            switch(c)
            {
                case 1:
                int m = sc.nextInt();
                if (m>=90){
                    System.out.println("THIS IS GOOD");
                }
                else if(m>60){
                    System.out.println("THIS IS ALSO GOOD");
                }
                else{
                    System.out.println("THIS IS GOOD AS WELL");
                }
                break;
                case 0:  System.out.println("PROGRAM STOPPED"); 
                return;
                default: System.out.println("INVALID INPUT");
            }
        }
    }
}
